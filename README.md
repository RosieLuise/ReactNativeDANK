# Dank Hous Virtual Tour (React Native)

Collaboration between RosieLuise and Cjmcclure1337 as a project for Nucamp's Front-End development bootcamp. Intended as a virtual tour of the Dank Hous Museum and Art Gallery in Chicago.

The focus of this project was the overall structure and functionality. Due to time constraints, styling was largely left as the default settings.
